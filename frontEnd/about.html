            <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hi there! I'm a passionate web developer. I got introduced to the world of coding through some friends who were already in the field, and I was instantly fascinated by it. Since then, I've been on an exciting journey of learning and exploring the endless possibilities that coding offers.
        </p>
        <p>
            Apart from coding, I have a deep love for traveling and experiencing new places and cultures. Exploring different destinations, trying local cuisines, and immersing myself in the beauty of nature are some of the things I enjoy. On weekends, you can often find me playing sports like basketball and softball, hiking in the nearby mountains, or hitting the golf course for a round of golf. I also have a soft spot for movie marathons and enjoy playing video games in my free time.
        </p>
        <p>
            Football is another passion of mine, and I proudly support the Detroit Lions! I love the excitement and camaraderie that come with watching and cheering for my favorite team.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm thrilled to be on this journey of continuous learning and growth in the world of web development. I'm looking forward to using my skills and creativity to build innovative and meaningful projects. Feel free to explore my portfolio and get in touch with me for any collaborations or opportunities.
